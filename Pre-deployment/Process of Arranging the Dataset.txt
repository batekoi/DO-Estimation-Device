- Paste to New File (follow code name format at the bottom of this file)
4. < Format as table >
- Make sure parameters names are uniform: "pH", "Specific conductance", "Temperature, water", "Turbidity", "Barometric pressure", "Dissolved Oxygen"
- if not, replace.
5. Run file on 'dataset formatter.py' program 
6. Double check the file.
